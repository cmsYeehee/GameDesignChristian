## Game engine:
MelonJS: No youtube videos! Simple, but there's just not enough information on this online

BabylonJS: While it does have 3d features, it looks way too difficult to actually be able to find anything.

Phaser: Seems like it can do 2.5d. It looks simple to use, and has various examples on it's website of how to use it. There are a bunch of youtube videos on it, and they wouldn't take too long to understand these videos to start coding.
