Art Style: Futuristic sci-fi, with neon city lights and destructible environments

Example starting screen above

Gameplay Mechanics
For each mission, you can deploy a combination of ships based on level nature and funding.

You get a starting screen, and the deploy zone comes up highlighted in gray, with tiles that you can place the ships on. An example is shown in the pdf file. 
The deployment zone image is given in the pdf file.

Vehicles unlock at different levels, and during battle, you can swap between vehicles to manually control each one.
AI controls other vehicles and the ones you haven't unlocked.
The gameplay is shown in the pdf file

Objectives
Offensive goals: Destruction, time-based objectives, and least fuel usage.
Vehicle Abilities

Shield/energy management; running vehicles uses power, and you risk overheating or running out of health.
Strategy involves managing energy levels and swapping between vehicles.


Attack Level
Snow scene with buildings

2D Gameplay
Ground and air vehicles on the same plane; air vehicles ignore terrain.
Arrow keys move the vehicle; space attacks in the forward direction.
Press "X" to explode the vehicle. Hold down "A" and "Z" to distribute power to guns and shields respectively for damage protection. Press 1 to transition to the nearest vehicle, and you get the same gameplay UI, just with a different vehicle as the perspective

An example of the bottom bar, gameplay, and terrain would be playing above it.

The camera follows air vehicle from a top-down perspective

Defense Mechanics
Turrets/Defenses: 250 health
Buildings: 500 health

Defensive Structures
Turrets: Basic defense
Turrets attack the nearest attack ship, shooting lasers at a 0.3 second interval directly ahead of the location of the user.

Air Defenses: Specialized for aerial enemies; limited range but high precision. Aerial defense projectiles fire twice the speed of turret projectiles and only target air vehicles


Capital Core: Heavily fortified; houses the city’s main defense systems.
Energy requirements (100 energy per turret).
5-15 shots per second. Destruction threshold: 200 hits.
Capital: 8000 health
Map

The map shows buildings—turrets spaced around buildings and more concentrated near capital buildings. Deploy zone at bottom corner/edge of the map. Enemy vehicles will also spawn basic walkers and jets at low frequency until the capital destroyed

Sound design
Ambient sounds always playing in background
Shocky laser sound when buildings/vehicles hit
Engine noises in background during gameplay
## each level already set out
## concentrations of defense buildings, bigger maps, higher health
## just have to destroy main tower.
