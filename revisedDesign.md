Game Design Overview
Target Audience
Competitive and casual gamers.
Strategy/action game.
Setting

## The city design should be described / created in depth. It is difficult to understand what the game looks like and how it plays without it.

Theme: Futuristic city under siege
Environment: 2D/2.5D cityscape with multi-layered defense lines
Art Style: Futuristic sci-fi, with neon city lights and destructible environments

Example starting screen above
Starting Screen
Includes options such as "Start Game" and "Settings".
Drones and Vehicles
Different drones you can control (futuristic):
Ground:
Basic walker

Cannon

Giant Mech.

Air: Base Plane

Heli

Capital Ship

Gameplay Mechanics
For each mission, you can deploy a combination of ships based on level nature and funding.

## how does the user choose the ships and what does it actually look like deployed in game

Vehicles unlock at different levels, and during battle, you can swap between vehicles to manually control each one.
AI controls other vehicles and the ones you haven't unlocked.

## what is the movement like, how does it all look while playing, there is currently no way of knowing how the game is meant to look while actually playing or anything like that

Objectives
Offensive goals: Destruction, time-based objectives, and least fuel usage.
Vehicle Abilities
Electric lasers, self-destruct features.

## how do you control these features, what keys etc

Shield/energy management; running vehicles uses power, and you risk overheating or running out of health.
Strategy involves managing energy levels and swapping between vehicles.

## what does it mean to manage energy levels, how does one do this and how can the user swap vehicles

Attack Level
Floating ground buildings

## what are floating ground buildings

2D Gameplay
Ground and air vehicles on the same plane; air vehicles ignore terrain.
Arrow keys move the vehicle; space attacks in the forward direction.
Press "Z" to explode the vehicle. Hold down "A" and "Z" to distribute power to guns and shields for damage protection.

## is "z" for self destruct or what

An example of the bottom bar, gameplay, and terrain would be playing above it.

## again what does the terrain actually look like, there are no tile maps or any map / level images

The camera follows air vehicle from a top-down perspective
Upgrades and Progression
Score-Based Unlocks: Players earn points from destroyed enemies, which can be used to unlock new units or upgrade existing ones.
Skill Tree System:
Offensive Upgrades: Improve weapon strength, rate of fire, and explosion radius.
Defensive Upgrades: Increase health and armor, upgrade shield durability, enhance repair speed.
Utility Upgrades: Boost vehicle speed, fuel efficiency, and power redistribution effectiveness.

Score System
Based on score, you get levels up to unlock other vehicles.
Objective: 100% destruction to win in 10 minutes.
Defense Mechanics

## explain the defense mechanics, what does this mean

Defensive Structures
Turrets: Basic defense

Air Defenses: Specialized for aerial enemies; limited range but high precision.

## again the design needs to be explained, currently the programmer would have to create everyting apart from the ship design and menu but no gameplay is shown

Capital Core: Heavily fortified; houses the city’s main defense systems.
Energy requirements (100 energy per turret).
5-15 shots per second. Destruction threshold: 200 hits.
Turrets/Defenses: 250 health
Buildings: 500 health
Capital: 8000 health
Map

The map shows buildings—turrets spaced around buildings and more concentrated near capital buildings. Deploy zone at bottom corner/edge of the map. Enemy vehicles will also spawn basic walkers and jets at low frequency until the capital destroyed

Sound design
Ambient sounds always playing in background
Shocky laser sound when buildings/vehicles hit
Engine noises in background during gameplay

## not all the images loaded so some comments may not apply. Still the main issue is understaanding what the game looks like while playing
